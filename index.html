          At the moment I am enrolled in the Bachelor's of Computer Information Systems program at 
          Mount Royal University. I am finishing up my first year and am looking for summer work. 
          I will be returning to school full time in the fall. I own a reliable car and am prepared to
          commute to work.

          <h3>Photography</h3>
          <p>
           I have extensive practice within the field of photography. Overall, it is a pretty good mix of 
           portrait and landscape work. My most recent gig was some photojournalism work. The result of which is 
           pictured below.

           Elvis just refused to smile for the camera, but otherwise, I am rather proud of how this one 
           turned out.

        <div class="grid-item"><h3>Programming</h3>
          <p>
           I have soem experience working with Java. Primarily in constructing inventory management
           software. Reading files, recieving and validating inputs, primitive database stuff. 
           I also have extensive practice with JavaFX. Both basic driver run GUI's and FXML file
           based applications. Most importantly though, I know how to get JavaFX to compile on JDK 17. 
           Libraries, VM arguments and the like.
          Why use more advanced and functional programs when you can use easy breezy beautiful JavaFX.

        <div class="grid-item"><h3>Microsoft Paint</h3>
          <p>
            One of my most well developed skills is with Microsoft Paint and by extension Paint 3D.
            Two of the most revered image editors in the world, these programs required years of training to 
            hone my craft. Below is an image that is the result of all of this blood sweat and tears:
            <img  class="gridImage" src= "images/thead.png" alt = "SUPER SENIOR! The Man the Legend!"
            width ="200" height ="150"/>
            My magnum opus, the colours, the 3D text, the slogan. A single piece of artistic brilliance that
            will never be matched. Take that Mozart, Vivaldi, Da Vinci! May their works fade into the sands of
            time. A thousand years from now every Tom, Dick and Harry will know not of Mona Lisa or concertos 
            but instead of the legend, SUPERSENIOR!
