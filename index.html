          <h3>The Planes of History</h3>
          <p>
            For a technology that has only existed for around a hundred and thirty there has been a massive 
            amount of change in its time. From the early gliders of the Victorians to the modern supersonic jets,
            The aero space sector has witnessed some of the greatest and most constant advances of any other tech.
            In the early ages of the airplane there was little of the technology we now take for granted. 
            The very first planes had open air cockpits and no navigation whatsoever. The pilot simply flew 
            by sight and educated guesses. Even as airlines started to develop through the thirties little changed.
            At one point large cement arrows were created across the United States pointing towards the nearest city.
            This was because the pilots still relied on sight to navigate. Therefore, they would hop between cities and 
            landmarks to prevent getting lost.

          <p>
            Accurate depictions of past aircraft are hard to find in most forms of media. In particular movies struggle to portray the simplest of 
        dogfights properly. One of the more recent films that tried to tackle this was Dunkirk. Christopher Nolan scrounged together
        three of the remainin operational Spitfires and endeavored to create a realistic dogfight for the viewer.
        His attempts, though admirable, fall well short of the goal. He portrays the RAF forces at Dunkirk as consisting of
        a lone squad of three fighters, when in reality 2,739 fighter sorties were flown. While te skies above the beach were
        light on air support this was because most of the fighters were miles away keeping the German bombers from even 
        reaching the beach. The fact of the matter is that despite how the movie shows it, the RAF saved many lives that
        day. It is worth noting that otherwise Dunkirk does do a very good job of recreating one of the hundreds of
        dogfights that occured that day.

        <div class="grid-item"><h3>Plane of the Month</h3>
          <p>
            The plane of the month for March is the hideously awful ME 262.
            This jet was a last ditch effort by Nazi Germany to regain control over
            the skies of Europe. It was mechanically unreliable, made out of wood and did
            nothing but waste Germany's little remaining resources. The jet engines had
            a very short service life. This was offset by the fact that the planes were either
            shot down, crashed or simply fell apart before the engines blew up. It is interesting
            to note that in popular culture Nazi technology is seen as more advanced and better than 
            allied equipment was. This jet is a direct rebuke of this idea. It was shoddily built
            using slave labour and did absolutely nothing but waste Germany's time and resources. As such this jet 
            likely helped speed along the end of WWII and saved thousands of lives as a result.
            For this feat we have chosen the ME 262 as our plane of the month.
