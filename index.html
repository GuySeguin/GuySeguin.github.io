            <h3>Education and Certification</h3>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Province of Alberta High School Diploma</li> <br>
                <li>Red Cross Standard First Aid and CPR</li><br>
                <li>Class 5 GDL Drivers License</li><br>

              </ul>
              At the moment I am enrolled in the Bachelor's of Computer Information Systems program at 
              Mount Royal University. I am finishing up my first year and am looking for summer work. 
              I will be returning to school full time in the fall. I own a reliable car and am prepared to
              commute to work.

          <h3>Experience</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Volunteering with Scouts Canada</li> <br>
              <li>Working for my Dad's business</li><br>
              </li><br>
            </ul>
             Minimal work experience so far. Volunteered with Scouts for a few years. Managed a Venturer Company, 
            ran a few camps and other outings. Otherwise most of the work I have done has been for my dad. 
            Spent a good chunk of last summer pouring sidewalks for his rental property. Other than that, some 
            small time work, painting houses, building fences, that sort of thing. Hopefully add some more
            work experience in the near future.

            <h3>Photography</h3>
            <p>
              I have extensive practice within the field of photography. Overall, it is a pretty good mix of 
              portrait and landscape work. My most recent gig was some photojournalism work. The result of which is 
              pictured below.

                width ="200" height ="150"/>
              Elvis just refused to smile for the camera, but otherwise, I am rather proud of how this one 
              turned out. The slight fuzziness of Elvis contrasts nicely with the sharpness of 
              Mark Zuckerberg. Overall, I would say that it is an inspired piece.

            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <p>
              I have soem experience working with Java. Primarily in constructing inventory management
              software. Reading files, recieving and validating inputs, primitive database stuff. 
              I also have extensive practice with JavaFX. Both basic driver run GUI's and FXML file
              based applications. Most importantly though, I know how to get JavaFX to compile on JDK 17. 
              Libraries, VM arguments and the like.
              Why use more advanced and functional programs when you can use easy breezy beautiful JavaFX.

            <h3>Microsoft Paint</h3>
            <p>
               One of my most well developed skills is with Microsoft Paint and by extension Paint 3D.
              Two of the most revered image editors in the world, these programs required years of training to 
              hone my craft. Below is an image that is the result of all of this blood sweat and tears:
              <img  class="gridImage" src= "images/thead.png" alt = "SUPER SENIOR! The Man the Legend!"
                width ="200" height ="150"/>
              My magnum opus, the colours, the 3D text, the slogan. A single piece of artistic brilliance that
              will never be matched. Take that Mozart, Vivaldi, Da Vinci! May their works fade into the sands of
              time. A thousand years from now every Tom, Dick and Harry will know not of Mona Lisa or concertos 
              but instead of the legend, SUPERSENIOR!

            <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
            <p>
              I know how to repair a Hiawatha 3.5hp outboard motor. I also know how to replace
              the fuel pump on a 2003 Subaru Forester, so that's handy. I am also fluent in 
              Dog Latin and have done some translation work in the past. I also play goalie in hockey, 
              where I am, statistically speaking better than nothing. Oh yeah, I also know a fair bit
              about developing and printing film in a darkroom, lots of utility there. Finally, one of
              my greatest achievements so far in my life was beating Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 on 
              veteran difficulty. My parents were extremely proud of me that day.
